**Next Milestones and Realistic Plan for a Functional Application**

The goal is to build a robust and user-friendly academic agenda application. Here's a proposed roadmap, building upon the existing features and addressing the outlined "Outstanding/Future Considerations":

**Phase 1: Core Coordinator & Admin Functionality (High Priority)**
*   **Milestone 1.1: Activity Approval & Reactivation:**
    *   Implement the views and logic for Coordinators/Administrators to change an activity's `aprobada` status (approve/disapprove) and `activa` status (reactivate soft-deleted activities).
    *   Ensure proper logging (`LogActividad`) for these actions.
    *   Integrate these actions into the Coordinator Dashboard UI (e.g., buttons, checkboxes).
*   **Milestone 1.2: Comprehensive Activity Logging View:**
    *   Develop a dedicated view and template for Coordinators/Administrators to easily review all `LogActividad` entries, providing a clear audit trail of activity changes.

**Phase 2: Student Experience Enhancement (Medium Priority)**
*   **Milestone 2.1: Student iCal Feed Generation:**
    *   Implement the functionality for students to generate personalized iCal feeds based on their selected subjects. This will involve adapting the existing `VistaCalendarioForm` and creating a dedicated view for students.
*   **Milestone 2.2: Student Dashboard Filtering:**
    *   Extend the filtering capabilities on the student dashboard to allow students to filter their activities by `titulacion`, `curso`, `semestre`, and `tipo_actividad`, similar to the coordinator dashboard.

**Phase 3: Internationalization & Usability (Medium Priority)**
*   **Milestone 3.1: Full Spanish Interface:**
    *   Complete the internationalization process by marking all user-facing strings for translation, generating message files, translating them, and compiling them. This will make the application fully usable in Spanish.
*   **Milestone 3.2: Date/Time Picker Integration:**
    *   Integrate a user-friendly date/time picker library into activity creation/editing forms to improve the user experience for inputting dates and times.

**Phase 4: Refinement & Deployment Preparation (Lower Priority / Ongoing)**
*   **Milestone 4.1: Code Cleanup & Refactoring:**
    *   Regularly review and refactor the codebase for readability, maintainability, and adherence to best practices. Remove all debug `print` statements.
*   **Milestone 4.2: Comprehensive Testing:**
    *   Develop and run comprehensive tests for all new and existing functionalities to ensure stability and correctness.
*   **Milestone 4.3: Deployment Strategy:**
    *   Plan and execute the deployment of the application to a public server. This is crucial for iCal links to work externally and for general accessibility. Consider using a service like `ngrok` for local testing of external access.

**Realistic Plan for Functionality:**

*   **Iterative Development:** Tackle one milestone at a time, ensuring each is fully functional and tested before moving to the next.
*   **Prioritization:** Focus on core functionalities (Phase 1) first, as they are critical for coordinator management.
*   **User Feedback:** Continuously seek feedback from potential users (teachers, students, coordinators) to guide development and prioritize features.
*   **Documentation:** Keep `user_manual.md`, `next_session_plan.md`, and `project_status.md` updated with every significant change.
